# OpenAI Story

## Goal

Explain how OpenAI tools were central to building Hook, not just embedded as a feature.

## Team Ownership

- Person A: platform, onboarding, dashboard, chat, docs, integration
- Person B: academic engine, degree data, clubs
- Person C: scholarships, research, internships, opportunity data

## Three-Worktree Setup

- `main`: Person A
- `feat/academic-clubs`: Person B
- `feat/opportunities`: Person C

## Major Files Codex Should Generate

- shared types and onboarding flow
- academic engine and academic UI
- scholarship and opportunity matchers
- clubs matcher and UI
- chat route and chat UI
- demo and pitch documentation

## Notes To Fill In During Build

- Which files Codex created directly
- Which files humans edited after review
- Where Codex saved time in parallel worktrees

## Build Notes

### A2 - Profile System and Demo Mode

- Codex generated the shared profile state layer in `lib/profile-context.tsx`.
- Codex generated the multi-step onboarding UI in `components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`.
- Codex generated the onboarding route in `app/onboarding/page.tsx`.
- This phase matters because the same student profile now powers every Hook surface instead of each page inventing its own data.
